# Maze Solver

This repository contains code for a Maze Solver, a program that navigates through a maze and finds a solution.

## Overview

The Maze Solver is designed to solve mazes using algorithms like Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search. It reads a maze from a file, processes the maze, and determines a path from the start to the end point if one exists.

## Features

- **Maze Input**: Read a maze from a file or accept it as input.
- **Algorithm Application**: Applies BFS and DFS to solve the maze.
- **Solution Output**: Display the solution path through the maze.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Graph Theory Algorithms**: Algorithms such as Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search.
- **File Input/Output**: Reading the maze from a file and writing the solution.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-solver.git
   ```
2. **Compile the Program**: Compile the java program using a compiler.
3. **Run the Program**: Run the program and give input maze.
